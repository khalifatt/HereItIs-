				<p><h5>Of course yes, read bellow!</h5></p>
      <p>Haitian Carnival is a celebration held over several weeks each year leading up to Mardi Gras. 
         Haitian Defile Kanaval is the Haitian Creole name of the main annual Mardi Gras carnival held in 
         Port-au-Prince, Haiti.</p>
      <p>The parade is known in Creole as "defile". Haiti's largest annual carnival is held in the capitol 
         and largest city, Port-au-Prince, with smaller celebrations taking part simultaneously in Jacmel, 
         Aux Cayes, and other locations in Haiti. The annual Kanaval celebrations coincide with other Mardi
         Gras carnivals around the world.<br>
         Haiti also has smaller carnival celebrations during the year that are separate from the main 
         Kanaval.</br> These include Rara, a series of processions taking place during the Catholic Lent season,
         that has bands and parades like the larger main Kanaval, and also an annual Kanaval de Fleur that 
         takes place in July.</p>

           <p>Konpa Kanaval Bands <b> esej.doc </b> 
Kanaval is an important event for Haitian musicians. Music styles created in Haiti have an opportunity to 
expand their audience by performing for Kanaval crowds. The most popular style of music at recent Kanavals 
is Compas music, also called Kompa, or Konpa in Haitian creole.

<p><h4>Kreyol La</h4></p>

Kreyol La is the third most popular band behind T-Vice and Djakout in Haiti's Kanaval. Each year the Band is 
in a competition with the rival Krezi Mizik, also known as Nou Krezi. <br> In 2007, Kreyol La win their first 
victory over Krezi and had a better meringue Kanaval than Krezi that year. In 2009 they won again over Krezi.

</br>It was stated that Kreyol La and T-Vice will finally be rivals in Kanaval but T-Vice will always be rivals 
with Djakout #1. <br>The Band was once named a successor konpa dirèk band, to one called Kompa Kreyòl, by David 
Dupoux who was once part of the band during Kompa Kreyòl era. Kreyol La is a similar band of their rival 
Krezi Mizik. Kreyol La is also similar to the group Konpa Dirèk, T-Vice and D.P. Express.</br><p></p>
