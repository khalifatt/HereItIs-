<h5>MIREBALAIS, Haiti</h5> — Under the leadership of the American NGO Partners In Health, led by Dr. Paul Farmer, 
the largest post-earthquake health project has finally materialized: the construction of the University 
Hospital of Mirebalais (HUM).</p>

<p>The Haitian government and its international partners, however, are still struggling to begin reconstruction
of the Hospital of the State University of Haiti (HUEH) — the main hospital in Port-au-Prince — about three 
years after the earthquake of January 12, 2010.</p>

<img src="images/hospital3.png" alt="image 01" class="center" />

<p>The rebuilding of HUEH, commonly known as the General Hospital, was one of the first projects to be approved
by the now-defunct Interim Commission for the Reconstruction of Haiti (IHRC). Created after the earthquake, 
the IHRC was co-chaired by former US President Bill Clinton and the Haitian prime minister, but it 
disappeared before the start of the hospital's reconstruction.</p>

<p>Three years after the disaster, HUEH continues to function in buildings that were badly damaged. Buildings 
that represent a real danger to the hospital have been demolished, including pediatrics, laboratory and 
maternity. All these services are currently housed in tents.</p>

<p>Patients in this public health facility believe that destroying some parts of the building gives hope that 
construction will begin soon. But nobody knows when that day will come.</p>

<p>"I do not know why the construction has not yet begun," said Christophia Saint-Jean, general secretary of 
the Union Employees of HUEH.</p>

<p>After a visit to Washington, DC in early 2012, former Haitian Prime Minister Garry Conille announced the 
start of construction for the month of May. Seven months later, there has not been any progress. The minister
of health, Dr. Florence Duperval Guillaume, cited technical complexities to explain the delay in starting 
work, while others have reported disagreements between the major donors who fund the project—the US, French, 
and Haitian governments.</p>
<img src="images/hosp1.png" alt="image 01" class="center" />
<p>In fact, the causes of blocking the reconstruction of HUEH seem to be deeper than what is currently known. 
Director general of the Ministry of Health (MSPP), Dr. Marie Guirlène Raymond Charité, declined to be 
interviewed on the subject, stating, "the reconstruction project at HUEH is a political issue.”</P?

<p>At a press conference last October, the minister of health announced that construction on the hospital would 
start before the second half of 2013 and would be completed in 2015.</p>

<p>"We know that the work will take three years, but we do not know when they will be launched," said another 
member of the board of the union of the hospital. He added, however, that he has had several meetings with 
members of hospital management regarding the reconstruction project. According to information provided by 
the Minister Duperval at the press conference, the work will be funded by the French, American and Haitian 
governments for $82 million. The initial cost of the project was $53.2 million, but the Haitian government 
agreed to contribute to the total.</p>

<p>"The Haitian government was under pressure from donors and will add the other $30 million," said an official 
of the Ministry of Health, on the condition of anonymity.</p>

<p>"This hospital is the culmination of a dream dating back a quarter century, and underlines our commitment to 
the country and people of Haiti, which is stronger than ever after the earthquake,” said Farmer, co-founder 
of Partners In Health.</p>

		<h2><span style="color:#80BFFF">Hopital universitaire de mirebalais </span></h2>
	
<p>the world’s largest solar powered hospital has just opened its doors in haiti and boasts over 1800 solar 
panels on its elegant and otherwise, stark, white rooftop. haiti’s central plateau is riddled with 
intermittent flows of energy- a fact that derails the possibilities of large-scale healthcare infrastructure.</p>
<p>In the specific region of mirebalais, located 30 miles north of the capital port-au-prince, outages occur for
an average of three hours each day.</p> <p> The new hopital universitaire de mirebalais, a venture of partners in 
health, will cover an area of 205,000 square feet and its 300 beds will assist in correcting a national 
healthcare system with scarce or disparate resources.</p>
