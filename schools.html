         <p><h4>The Education System in Haiti</h4></p>
                <p> Like in many countries, in Haiti, there are some schools that are so expensive, belong to the 
                    wealthiest people and to the regressively class.</p>

	 <img src="images/school1.png" alt="image 01" class="center" /></div> 

                <p>The founders of Haiti’s first constitution in 1805 states “… Free Education for all” and the 
                   Constitution of 1987 in Article 32 “…guarantees the right to Education”; however, Haiti’s literacy 
                   rate at 52.9 %, remains one of the lowest in the world.<br></br> The Ministry of Education, due to financial 
                   limitations, has not been able to fulfill this obligation and the regulation of schools has been 
                   disorganized.<br></br> This literally means that anyone can open a school at any level of education, recruit 
                   students and hire teachers, without having to meet minimum standards.  Income inequalities have also 
                   led to sharp disparities among the regions and social classes of the nation.<br></br> As a result, 80% of the 
                   students attend private schools, despite the economic burden it creates for families. </p>
           <p></p>

	 <img src="images/school2.png" alt="image 01" class="center" /></div> 

         <p>The January 2010 earthquake placed an already deficient system faced with years of mismanagement, over 
            crowdedness, precarious physical conditions, and limited number of qualified teachers into an indeterminate 
            state.<br></br> It is estimated that nearly 1.3 million children under the age of 18 were affected directly or 
            indirectly by this catastrophe and had their schooling disrupted or halted.</p>
         <img src="images/school6.png" alt="image 01" class="center" />
         <p></p>   
         <p>In response, the Haitian government, along with international support, diligently created and attempted to 
            implement a program that prioritized the prompt “back to school” for the affected children. A coordinated
            effort is emerging to improve teacher training, student enrollment, attendance and completion. <br></br>
            Several pilot projects such as Programme de Scolarisation Universelle Gratuite et Obligatoire (PSUGO), or 
            the Haitian Educator Leadership Program (HELP), are focusing on the improvement of education in Haiti and 
            they seem promising.</p>
        <img src="images/school5.png" alt="school" class="center" /> 
        <p></p>
         
        <p>It is hoped that a sustainable education system will emerge from the rubble of the earthquake. This system 
            should facilitate a quality education for all, which complements the wonderfully kind nature of the Haitian 
            people, and serves as an avenue to the food, housing, employment, health, and transportation needs of this 
            devastated country. <br></br>This system can only come about through the lasting commitment to accessibility from 
            within Haiti and the world outside.  The only way out of this situation is accessibility.
       <img src="images/school4.png" alt="school" class="center" />
        

        <p>Here, at the Rubicon International Foundation, we are committed to creating educational opportunities for 
           children whose access has been severely limited or affected by crisis.</p>
